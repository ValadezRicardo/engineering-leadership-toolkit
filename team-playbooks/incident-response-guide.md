# Incident Response Guide

**Comprehensive framework for effective incident management in business-critical systems**

## 🚨 Severity Classification

### Severity 1 (Critical) - Immediate Response
**SLA: 15 minutes**
- **Payment systems completely down**
- **Total loss of primary functionality**
- **Confirmed security breach**
- **Critical data loss**
- **Impact on > 50% of users**

### Severity 2 (High) - Urgent Response
**SLA: 1 hour**
- **Significant performance degradation**
- **Primary functionality partially affected**
- **Impact on 10-50% of users**
- **Monitoring systems failing**
- **Critical integrations intermittent**

### Severity 3 (Medium) - Scheduled Response
**SLA: 4 business hours**
- **Secondary functionality affected**
- **Performance degraded but functional**
- **Impact on < 10% of users**
- **Significant UX issues**
- **Non-critical system alerts**

### Severity 4 (Low) - Next Sprint
**SLA: 2 business days**
- **Minor cosmetic or UX issues**
- **Nice-to-have functionality affected**

- **Performance optimizations**

## 📞 Escalation and Communication

### 1. Incident Detection

#### Detection Sources
- **Automated monitoring** (Grafana, DataDog, CloudWatch)
- **User reports** (support, Slack, email)
- **Internal reports** (development team, QA)
- **Security alerts** (automated scans, pentesting)

#### First Steps (0-5 minutes)
1. **Confirm the incident** - Is this really a problem?
2. **Assess initial severity** using matrix above
3. **Create incident ticket** in tracking system
4. **Notify #incidents Slack** with severity
5. **Assign Incident Commander** based on severity

### 2. Roles and Responsibilities

#### Incident Commander (IC)
**Responsibilities:**
- **Coordinate overall response** to the incident
- **Communicate updates** to stakeholders
- **Make escalation decisions** and resource allocation
- **Facilitate post-mortem** after resolution

**Rotation Schedule:**
- **Monday-Wednesday:** Backend Tech Lead
- **Thursday-Friday:** Frontend Tech Lead  
- **Weekend:** Manager on-call

#### Subject Matter Expert (SME)
**Responsibilities:**
- **Deep technical diagnosis** of the problem
- **Implement immediate and permanent fixes**
- **Provide specific expertise** for affected systems
- **Document technical findings** for post-mortem

#### Communications Lead
**Responsibilities:**
- **Update external stakeholders** (customers, partners)
- **Coordinate with legal/PR** if necessary
- **Maintain status page** updates
- **Document communications timeline**

### 3. Communication Channels

#### Slack Channels
- **#incidents** - Primary communication during incidents
- **#incidents-sev1** - Critical incidents only
- **#status-updates** - Updates for entire company
- **#postmortems** - Learnings and follow-ups

#### Escalation Tree
```
Severity 1: IC → Engineering Manager → CTO → CEO
Severity 2: IC → Engineering Manager → CTO
Severity 3: IC → Tech Lead → Engineering Manager
Severity 4: Assigned Developer → Tech Lead
```

#### External Communications
- **Status Page:** [company-status.com] - Automated updates
- **Customer Support:** Via Zendesk integration
- **Partners/Vendors:** Direct email templates
- **Media/PR:** Through designated spokesperson only

## 🔧 Technical Procedures

### 1. Initial Investigation (First 30 minutes)

#### Information to Gather
- [ ] **Exact timestamp** of problem onset
- [ ] **Affected services/systems** specifically
- [ ] **Impacted user segments** (all, specific, region)
- [ ] **Specific error messages** and relevant logs
- [ ] **Recent deployments** in last 24 hours
- [ ] **Recent infrastructure changes**
- [ ] **External dependencies** with known issues

#### Quick Diagnosis Commands
```bash
# Check system health
kubectl get pods -n production
docker ps | grep unhealthy

# Database connectivity
psql -h prod-db.company.com -U readonly -c "SELECT 1;"
redis-cli -h prod-redis.company.com ping

# Recent deployments
kubectl rollout history deployment/api-service -n production
git log --oneline --since="24 hours ago"

# Error rates
curl -s "https://api.datadog.com/api/v1/query?query=sum:error.rate{service:api}" \
  -H "DD-API-KEY: $DD_API_KEY" -H "DD-APP-KEY: $DD_APP_KEY"
```

### 2. Containment and Mitigation

#### Immediate Actions (Severity 1-2)
```bash
# Traffic routing away from affected systems
kubectl scale deployment unhealthy-service --replicas=0
# Route traffic to backup region
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z123 --change-batch file://failover.json

# Database emergency procedures
# Enable read-only mode if write operations are problematic
UPDATE system_config SET maintenance_mode = true WHERE id = 1;

# Rate limiting for API overload
redis-cli SET rate_limit:emergency "100" EX 3600
```

#### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Application rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/api-service -n production
kubectl rollout status deployment/api-service -n production

# Database rollback (CRITICAL - require confirmation)
# Only if data loss is acceptable and within recovery window
pg_restore --clean --if-exists -d production backup_20240524.sql

# Infrastructure rollback
terraform plan -target=aws_instance.api_servers
terraform apply -target=aws_instance.api_servers
```

### 3. Monitoring During Incident

#### Key Metrics Dashboard
- **Error Rate:** Target < 0.1%
- **Response Time:** P95 < 500ms, P99 < 2s
- **Throughput:** Requests per second vs. baseline
- **Database Performance:** Query time, connection pool
- **Infrastructure:** CPU, Memory, Disk I/O per service

#### Automated Monitoring Setup
```bash
# Create incident-specific dashboard
curl -X POST "https://api.datadog.com/api/v1/dashboard" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "DD-API-KEY: $DD_API_KEY" \
  -d @incident-dashboard-template.json

# Enable enhanced logging
kubectl patch deployment api-service -p \
  '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"api","env":[{"name":"LOG_LEVEL","value":"DEBUG"}]}]}}}}'
```
