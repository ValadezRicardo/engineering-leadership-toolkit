## 🔍 Common Evaluation Pitfalls

### Cognitive Biases to Avoid
- **Confirmation Bias:** Favoring information that confirms pre-existing beliefs
- **Anchoring Bias:** Over-relying on first piece of information encountered
- **Bandwagon Effect:** Choosing popular solutions without proper evaluation
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Continuing with current solution due to past investment

### Process Mistakes
- **Insufficient requirements gathering** leading to misaligned solutions
- **Skipping proof of concept** and relying only on vendor demos
- **Underestimating TCO** by focusing only on upfront costs
- **Ignoring non-functional requirements** like scalability and security
- **Not involving end users** in the evaluation process

### Decision Traps
- **Analysis paralysis** - over-analyzing without making a decision
- **Perfect solution myth** - waiting for a solution that meets 100% of needs
- **Short-term focus** - optimizing for immediate needs without long-term vision
- **Technology bias** - choosing based on technical preferences rather than business value
