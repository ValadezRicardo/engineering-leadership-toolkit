## 🔄 Data Migration Strategy

### Data Migration Planning
**Data Classification:**
| Data Type | Volume | Criticality | Migration Method | Downtime Required |
|-----------|--------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **User Data** | _[500GB]_ | _[Critical]_ | _[Real-time sync]_ | _[<30 minutes]_ |
| **Transaction History** | _[1.2TB]_ | _[Critical]_ | _[Bulk + incremental]_ | _[2 hours]_ |
| **Logs & Analytics** | _[5TB]_ | _[Low]_ | _[Bulk transfer]_ | _[24 hours]_ |
| **Configuration** | _[10MB]_ | _[High]_ | _[Manual export/import]_ | _[15 minutes]_ |

### Data Migration Process
#### Pre-Migration Data Preparation
```sql
-- Example: Data validation queries
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE email IS NULL OR email = '';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE created_at > updated_at;
SELECT table_name, table_rows FROM information_schema.tables;
```

#### Migration Scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example migration script structure

# 1. Pre-migration validation
echo "Starting pre-migration validation..."
./scripts/validate_source_data.py

# 2. Initial bulk transfer
echo "Starting bulk data transfer..."
./scripts/bulk_transfer.py --source mysql://... --target postgresql://...

# 3. Incremental sync setup
echo "Setting up incremental sync..."
./scripts/setup_replication.py

# 4. Data transformation
echo "Applying data transformations..."
./scripts/transform_data.py

# 5. Post-migration validation
echo "Validating migrated data..."
./scripts/validate_target_data.py
```

### Data Validation Strategy
**Validation Checkpoints:**
- [ ] **Row Count Validation** - Ensure all records migrated
- [ ] **Data Integrity Checks** - Validate relationships and constraints
- [ ] **Sample Data Verification** - Manual review of representative data
- [ ] **Business Logic Validation** - Functional testing with migrated data
- [ ] **Performance Testing** - Query performance with migrated data

**Validation Queries:**
```sql
-- Row count comparison
SELECT 'source' as system, COUNT(*) as count FROM source.users
UNION ALL
SELECT 'target' as system, COUNT(*) as count FROM target.users;

-- Data integrity checks
SELECT user_id FROM target.orders 
WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM target.users);

-- Sample data validation
SELECT * FROM target.users 
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'
ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 100;
```
